# The basics of Git and Git Hub
## Introduction-  Git and Git hub
**GIT**
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code, enabling collaboration among developers. It supports branching, merging, and provides a history of code changes.

**GITHUB**
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It adds collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and a web interface for managing and sharing code. It's widely used for code hosting and project collaboration.

## Version Control System (VCS):
A system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revisit and revert to specific versions. Git is a distributed VCS, meaning each developer has a complete project history on their machine.


## The Github flow
The GitHub flow is a workflow designed to work well with Git and GitHub.

It focuses on branching and makes it possible for teams to experiment freely, and make deployments regularly.

The GitHub flow works like this:

1. Create a new Branch
2. Make changes and add Commits
3. Open a Pull Request
4. Review
5. Deploy
6. Merge
   
## What are Repositories ?
A Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. It is a crucial component of the Git version control system, which enables collaborative development and allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.

## Branch:
A branch is a divergent path of development. Creating branches allows you to work on features or fixes separately. Branches can be merged back into the main branch when ready.

## Merge:
Merging combines changes from different branches. After completing work on a feature branch, you can merge it back into the main branch to integrate those changes.

## What is Cloning ?
If a project has already been set up in a central repository, the git clone command is the most common way for users to obtain a development copy.Once a developer has obtained a working copy, all version control operations and collaborations are managed through their local repository.

## Commit and push 
 Commit - Think of a git commit as a snapshot that make up a file system. When you commit, you save your project, and Git records the work by taking a snapshot of the metadata and saving it in the local repository.
 Push - When all the updates are completed at the local level. When you’re ready to share them with other developers, you move, or “push” the changes to the remote repository. You actively push the commits using the Git push command. The commits are now viewable by other developers in your collaboration circle or to the public at large.

## Pull Request (PR):
A pull request is a way to propose changes. It's often used for collaboration, allowing developers to review and discuss changes before merging them into the main codebase.

## Conflict:
Conflicts happen when Git can't automatically merge changes from different branches. They require manual resolution to reconcile conflicting modifications.

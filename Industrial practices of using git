1. Focus on workflows:

Feature branches: Isolated development of new features.
Release branches: Controlled rollouts of major/minor versions.
Gitflow: Structured framework for efficient branching.

2. Tools for collaboration:

Pull requests: Code review before merging changes.
CI/CD pipelines: Automated builds, tests, and deployments.
Issue trackers: Organize tasks and link code changes to requirements.

3. Security and control:

User roles & permissions: Granular access to branches and repositories.
Two-factor authentication: Extra layer of security.
Code signing: Verify code integrity before deployment.

4. Automation and standardization:

Git hooks: Automate pre/post commit tasks.
Git templates: Pre-configured repositories for consistency.
Automated testing: Continuous validation of code quality and compatibility.

5. Adaptation is key: Choose the workflow and tools that suit your team and project.

Concept of Git and various terms related to it.
* Git:
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code, enabling collaboration among developers. It supports branching, merging, and provides a history of code changes.

* GitHub:
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It adds collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and a web interface for managing and sharing code. It's widely used for code hosting and project collaboration.

* Version Control System (VCS):
A system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revisit and revert to specific versions. Git is a distributed VCS, meaning each developer has a complete project history on their machine.

* Repository (Repo):
A repository is a storage space for your project files and their entire history. It can be local on your machine or hosted remotely. Repositories can be public or private.

* Commit:
A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a particular moment. It captures changes made to one or more files and is identified by a unique hash.

* Branch:
A branch is a divergent path of development. Creating branches allows you to work on features or fixes separately. Branches can be merged back into the main branch when ready.

* Merge:
Merging combines changes from different branches. After completing work on a feature branch, you can merge it back into the main branch to integrate those changes.

* Pull Request (PR):
A pull request is a way to propose changes. It's often used for collaboration, allowing developers to review and discuss changes before merging them into the main codebase.

* Clone:
Cloning a repository means making a local copy on your machine. It includes the entire project history and is typically the first step when starting to work on a project.

* Fetch:
Fetching retrieves changes from a remote repository to your local machine but doesn't automatically merge them. It's useful for staying updated without altering your working branch.

* Pull:
Pulling is a combination of fetching changes and merging them into your current branch. It's a convenient way to update your local copy with changes from a remote repository.

* Push:
Pushing involves uploading your local changes to a remote repository, making them accessible to others. It's how you share your work and update the central repository.

* Remote:
A remote is a version of the repository hosted elsewhere, like on GitHub or GitLab. It serves as a centralized point for collaboration.

* Conflict:
Conflicts happen when Git can't automatically merge changes from different branches. They require manual resolution to reconcile conflicting modifications.
